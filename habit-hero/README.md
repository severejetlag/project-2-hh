# Habit Hero

## A new way to learn good habits

### What does it do?

Habit Hero is an app that helps people keep track of the good habits they want to cultivate, as well as track their success rate at achieving weekly habit-practice goals.

Example: Xavier wants to get into meditation, so they add a "meditation" habit with a goal of meditating 3x/week. With Habit Hero, Xavier can log their practice metrics each day and view their weekly progress.

Stretch goal: enable a chart view to compare weekly success metrics for each habit they are tracking.

### MVP features
- a weekly table view that shows your habits and times you've practiced
- a daily habit-logging view that allows you to report whether or not you practiced your habit
- a profile view to update your user details such as email etc

### Stretch goals/wish list

- a chart view for each habit that shows your success rate (how many times you successfully practiced your new habit(s) compared to your weekly goal) on a week-by-week basis
- Email a weekly habit report to users

### Technologies
- Gems: groupdate, chartkick, FFaker, jQuery, materialize

### Teamwork plan
- Nick will do scss/sass, pair on app routing with Steph, controller data queries  
- Ray will do user auth, sessions routing, auth data validation
- Steph will do general app routing, controllers and views
- as more work comes up, we will divide it appropriately.

### Team communication
- we will use our slack channel to communicate when we are working on features to avoid merge conflicts
- we will slack + review each other's pull requests to the main repo (not merge our own PRs)
